# AI Passage Evaluation

## What Went Well

**1. Completed 3-Stage Cycle**
- Planning → Monitoring → Evaluating all documented
- Clear task definition with explicit goal and potential obstacles

**2. Accurate Forecasting**
- Time estimate (1 hour) matched actual (~1 hour or slightly less)
- Difficulty estimate (Easy) was accurate
- Identified the right risk (AWS permissions) even though it didn't occur

**3. Exceeded Expected Output**
- Not only verified pipeline works, but also created a demo video
- Proactively shared results with PM (Anshita)
- Identified clear next steps (continue with Abhinav)

**4. Good Documentation**
- References section includes video link with correct path
- Notes capture key metrics (8 min pipeline time)

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Passage Plan Could Be More Specific**
- "May need video recording" was vague
- **Suggestion**: If video is part of the deliverable, include it explicitly in Task list

**2. Log Missing Some Details**
- Didn't mention the fork sync step took how long
- **Suggestion**: Consider adding timestamps or duration for each major step

---

## Overall Grade: A-

- Excellent forecast accuracy (both time and difficulty)
- Complete 3-stage cycle with proper documentation
- Added value beyond the original task (demo video + sharing)
- Minor improvement: be more explicit about deliverables in planning

---

## Patterns to Watch
- Video recording wasn't planned as a definite task but was completed - consider making implicit tasks explicit
- Self-reflection on communication skills shows growth mindset
- Good habit: identifying next steps before closing the passage
