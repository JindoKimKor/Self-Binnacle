## Forecast Review

### Time
- Forecast: 1 hour
- Actual: ~1 hour (slightly less)
- Was it accurate? Why?
Expected pipeline to take longer, but it completed successfully in 8m 20s. This made the whole process smoother and resulted in a clean 3-minute demo video.

### Difficulty
- Forecast: Easy
- Actual: Easy
- Was it accurate? Why?
No AWS permission issues. Merge and deployment went smoothly as expected.

### How can I forecast better next time?
- Need to keep improving how I structure and communicate updates. Maybe try using labels/categories consistently? Even though time and difficulty were accurate this time, building the skill to organize and deliver information efficiently would speed things up and benefit me in the long run.
