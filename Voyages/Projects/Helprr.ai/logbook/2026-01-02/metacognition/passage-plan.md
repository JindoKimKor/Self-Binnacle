## Passage Plan (Planning)

### Task
- Test AWS CodePipeline by merging from Forked Repo to Base Repo
- Goal: Verify pipeline triggers and runs correctly after merge (success or failure)
- No documentation needed - reusable demo flow already exists
- Note: May need video recording, could add complexity

### Time Estimate
- How long will it take? 1 hour
- Why do I think so? Simple merge operation, just need to verify pipeline triggers

### Difficulty Estimate
- How well can I do this? Easy
- Why do I think so? (including expected obstacles)
Straightforward merge task. Only concern: potential AWS permission issues.
