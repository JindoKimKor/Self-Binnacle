## Forecast Review

### Time
- Forecast: 2-3 hours
- Actual: 5 hours
- Was it accurate? Why? Wrong. Testing once then documenting from scratch with screenshots took longer than expected.

### Difficulty
- Forecast: Medium
- Actual: Easy
- Was it accurate? Why? Wrong. AWS cloud permission concepts and structures are similar to Azure so adapted quickly, and expected obstacle (needing running service) wasn't an issue.

### How can I forecast better next time?
- Underestimated documentation time. Writing docs with screenshots takes 2x+ longer than the work itself.
- Consider the "do once, then document from start" pattern when estimating time.
