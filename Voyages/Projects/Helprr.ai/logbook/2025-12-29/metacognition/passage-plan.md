## Passage Plan (Planning)

### Task
- Research AWS CodePipeline developer permission setup
- Create test pipeline in my account to test IAM permissions directly
- Write Setup Guide, Developer Guide, Maintenance Guide documents in Confluence

### Time Estimate
- How long will it take? 2-3 hours
- Why do I think so? I have experience with cloud permission setup from VARLab, and documentation should be straightforward with screenshots

### Difficulty Estimate
- How well can I do this? Medium
- Why do I think so? (including expected obstacles) I have Azure experience but no AWS experience yet, still unfamiliar with AWS services. Also wondered if I need an actual running service to test the pipeline
