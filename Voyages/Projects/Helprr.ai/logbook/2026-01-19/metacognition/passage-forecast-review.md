## Forecast Review

### Time
- Forecast: Not explicitly estimated, but expected documentation to take long based on previous experience (2025-12-29)
- Actual: ~3 hours
- Was it accurate? Why? Yes. Previous lesson learned: "Writing docs with screenshots takes 2x+ longer than the work itself" - this held true.

### Difficulty
- Forecast: Not estimated
- Actual: Medium - required pivot from Classic to Ruleset mid-task
- Was it accurate? Why? N/A

### How can I forecast better next time? (Metacognition)
- Previous documentation experience (2025-12-29) helped set realistic expectations
- Creating outline/skeleton first reduced uncertainty and helped manage time
- When working with unfamiliar features (Classic vs Ruleset), budget extra time for exploration
