## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Completed GitHub Branch Protection documentation draft (~3 hours)
- Tested Ruleset on public repo (GitHub-Branch-Protection-Features-Test)
- Pivoted from Classic to Ruleset (to use "Restrict who can push" option on Personal repo)
- Captured screenshots
- Create document in Confluence "Push to Production" folder
- Attach screenshots
- Share with Anshita
- Reply to Anshita's title offer

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
- Creating document outline/skeleton first was effective
- Understanding Ruleset vs Classic differences took time but resulted in better choice
- AI collaboration for document structure/content review was helpful

### Next Steps

### Notes
- Changed plan from Classic Branch Protection to Ruleset
  - Reason: "Restrict who can push" option only available for Organization repos in Classic
  - Ruleset available for Personal repos
  - Can apply different rules per branch (Target Branches)
