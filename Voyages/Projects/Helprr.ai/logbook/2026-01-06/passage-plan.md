## Passage Plan (Planning)

### Task
- What will I do? (including approach)
Create AWS IAM Policy in my account. This time, create two S3 buckets and configure access so only one is visible. Also need to create two CodePipelines.
Then write documentation with screenshots.

### Time Estimate
- How long will it take? 2 hours
- Why do I think so? Probably around 1 hour for the work itself, but previously learned not to underestimate documentation time.

### Difficulty Estimate
- How well can I do this? Easy
- Why do I think so? (including expected obstacles)
Unless AWS documentation is poorly written and hard to find solutions:
- Create two S3 buckets
- Create a CodePipeline for each S3 and connect them
- Then configure so only one is visible to the user
Very straightforward.
