## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Completed as planned
1. Created two S3 buckets
2. Created two CodePipelines
3. Configured IAM Policy so users can only access one CodePipeline
4. Created documentation with screenshots
5. Sent message with completed document link

### Blockers
- Had to use AI assistance for some confusing S3 and CodePipeline configuration settings
- Still relied heavily on AI for documentation writing, especially content creation - but with clear intent and purpose

### Reflection
- If I understand what I'm doing and can evaluate the purpose, technology, and output, AI can be a powerful tool. But without that awareness, it feels like it could easily take over.

### Next Steps
- If PM wants documentation similar to the GitHub Branch Protection research, I can provide it. Otherwise, this will likely be my last activity.

### References
-

### Notes
- Learned that AWS IAM Policy for CodePipeline doesn't work as "show only what I allow". Instead, multiple permissions (ListPipelines, ListPipelineExecutions, etc.) work together on a single page. Permission control isn't as intuitive as the UI suggests.
