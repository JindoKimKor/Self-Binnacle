# AI Passage Evaluation

## What Went Well
- Time estimate was highly accurate (2 hours forecast vs 1 hour 45 minutes actual = 87.5% accuracy)
- Difficulty estimate matched reality - correctly assessed as Easy
- Clear step-by-step documentation of what was accomplished
- Valuable technical insight recorded in Notes about IAM Policy behavior
- Honest reflection about AI usage - acknowledging both benefits and concerns

## Areas for Improvement
- References section is empty - could link to AWS IAM documentation or the created guide
- Blockers section could be more specific about which settings were confusing

## Overall Grade: A
- Excellent forecast accuracy demonstrates growing intuition from prior experience
- Complete metacognition cycle (Planning → Monitoring → Evaluating) executed well
- Thoughtful reflection on AI as a tool vs dependency

## Patterns to Watch
- Consistent accuracy in time estimation when task is familiar - leverage this for similar future tasks
- Self-awareness about AI reliance is healthy - continue evaluating when AI assistance adds value vs creates dependency
