## Why
- Package VARLab's CI/CD infrastructure as open-source plug-and-play solution
- Enable Unity developers to use serverless build/test without DevOps expertise

## What
Open-source tool for Unity developers. Democratizing VARLab's serverless build/test environment (94.88% cost reduction) by packaging it as plug-and-play cloud architecture requiring no DevOps or cloud knowledge.

## How

### Workflow (per session)
1. Check GitHub project → AI ready → Open docs for notes → Open project

### Development Cycle
1. Check Issue
2. Create Branch (feature/issue-#-description)
3. Work + Commit (multiple commits per working unit)
4. Create PR + "Closes #N"
5. PR Merge → Issue auto-close
6. All Issues in Milestone done → Close Milestone
7. Write dev session notes
8. Create new Milestone/Issues → Repeat

### Issue Checklist
- Clear scope
- Tasks checklist
- Acceptance Criteria
- Technical Notes
- Dependencies (other Issues needed?)
- Milestone link
- Labels (enhancement, bug, testing, etc.)
- Estimate/Priority/Size (optional)
