# AI Passage Evaluation

## What Went Well

**1. First Session Documentation**
- Captured initial workshop direction and scope
- Recorded key decisions (audience assumptions, 2-day structure)
- Miro board reference included

**2. Honest Reflection**
- Acknowledged difficulty in outlining approach
- Identified need for a method/framework for workshop structuring
- Shows self-awareness about the process

**3. Clear Next Steps**
- "Think through details, use cases, and scenarios" - actionable direction

**4. Blockers Documented**
- Internet connection issues noted - useful for future session planning

## Areas for Improvement

**1. No Time/Difficulty Forecast**
- Marked as N/A for first exploratory session
- **Suggestion**: Even exploratory sessions can have rough estimates (e.g., "~2-3 hours for initial brainstorm")

**2. Missing Forecast Review Content**
- Forecast review file exists but minimal content
- **Suggestion**: Even without formal forecast, could note "actual time: 3 hours" and reflect on whether that felt appropriate

**3. Log Could Be More Detailed**
- "Created workshop outline in Miro board" - what specifically was created?
- **Suggestion**: List key topics/frames discussed, even in bullet form

---

## Overall Grade: B

- Good first documentation of a new project
- Captured the essential decisions and blockers
- Reflection shows growth mindset
- Missing forecasts make it hard to evaluate planning accuracy
- Log could benefit from more specific details about what was created

---

## Patterns to Watch
- First sessions often lack forecasts - consider establishing "exploratory session" forecast patterns
- Miro board as primary artifact - ensure key decisions are captured in log, not just referenced
- Collaborative sessions (with Dany) may need different documentation approach than solo work
