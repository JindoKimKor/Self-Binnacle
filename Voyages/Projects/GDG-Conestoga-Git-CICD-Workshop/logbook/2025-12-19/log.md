## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Discord call with Dany (9:40 AM ~ 12:40 PM, 3 hours)
- Created workshop outline in Miro board
- Estimated audience level: assumed some Git knowledge already:
  - Day 1: Manual deployment → Auto deployment on Main merge
  - Day 2: Manual Lint & Test → Auto Lint & Test on PR creation
  - Plus: Introduce other tools (Bitbucket, Jenkins, etc.)
- Frame 1: Brainstormed potential topics/components to include
- Note: Git/GitHub basics session was added later (not in this session)

### Blockers
- Internet connection issues during call (had to reconnect)

### Reflection
- Harder than expected to figure out how to approach outlining the workshop
- Would be helpful to have a good method/framework for structuring workshop content

### Next Steps
- Think through details, use cases, and scenarios for each session
