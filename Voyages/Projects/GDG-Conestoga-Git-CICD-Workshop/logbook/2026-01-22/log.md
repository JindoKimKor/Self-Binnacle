## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Reviewed Discord conversation with Olena to verify voyage-plan captured all requirements
- Created 9 Sailing Orders for all 3 workshops (Content Prep, Posting Delivery, Delivery)
- Defined Workshop 1 direction and approach:
  - Concept: Focus on "why" rather than command usage (AI can handle commands)
  - Use cases: Why companies require Git knowledge, "game rules" analogy
  - Approach: Question-based (Socratic method) - Question → Discussion → Concept → Hands-on
  - Format: Course Outline focused (PPT/Thumbnail generated by AI)
  - Hands-on environment plan: Branch Protection, Commit Convention (Commitlint + Husky), PR template
- Translated all Sailing Orders from Korean to English
- Regenerated dashboard and committed/pushed changes

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
- Planning backwards from the deadline helped clarify what needs to be done and when
- Focusing on "why" instead of commands makes sense in AI era - understanding rules is more valuable than memorizing syntax

### Next Steps
- Set up hands-on practice repository with constraints
- Start drafting Workshop 1 Course Outline

### Notes
