## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Discord call with Dany (7:04 PM ~ 10:00 PM, ~3 hours)
- Completed detailed Use Cases for CI/CD workshop
- Direction: Let learners experience pipeline with minimal setup
- Key learning outcomes defined for each section
- Discovered audience likely doesn't know Git → decided to add Git/GitHub basics session
- Result: Workshop expanded from 2 sessions to 3 (+ 1 reserved)

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
- Knowledge transfer to others is harder than expected - need to think about how to explain things clearly, not just what to cover

### Next Steps
- Create Git/GitHub basics session outline (not yet detailed)
- Create presentation slides and do a rehearsal run
