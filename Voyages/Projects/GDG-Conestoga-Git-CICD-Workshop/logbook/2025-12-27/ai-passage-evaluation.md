# AI Passage Evaluation

## What Went Well

**1. Significant Progress Documented**
- Completed detailed Use Cases for entire CI/CD workshop
- Clear direction established ("minimal setup, experience pipeline")
- Learning outcomes defined for each section

**2. Key Decision Captured**
- Discovered audience likely doesn't know Git
- Pivoted to add Git/GitHub basics session
- Workshop scope change documented (2 → 3 sessions + 1 reserved)

**3. Good Reflection**
- "Knowledge transfer is harder than expected" - valuable insight
- Recognized need to think about *how* to explain, not just *what*

**4. Actionable Next Steps**
- Create Git/GitHub basics outline
- Create presentation slides and rehearsal
- Clear path forward

## Areas for Improvement

**1. No Time/Difficulty Forecast**
- Same pattern as 12/19 - marked N/A
- **Suggestion**: Even collaborative sessions can estimate time (e.g., "planning to spend ~2-3 hours")

**2. Use Cases Not Captured in Log**
- Detailed Use Cases ([1]-[5]) were created but not summarized in log
- **Suggestion**: At minimum, list section titles in log for searchability
- Consider storing detailed Use Cases in resources/ folder

**3. Missing Forecast Review**
- Actual time (~3 hours) noted but no reflection on whether that was appropriate
- **Suggestion**: "Was 3 hours enough? Too much? What would be ideal?"

---

## Overall Grade: B+

- Major milestone achieved (Use Cases complete)
- Good pivot decision documented
- Reflection shows learning about knowledge transfer
- Still missing forecasts, making it hard to build estimation patterns
- Detailed work product (Use Cases) could be better preserved

---

## Patterns to Watch
- Collaborative planning sessions consistently lack forecasts - establish a pattern for these
- Major deliverables created in external tools (Miro) - ensure key content is captured in Self-Binnacle
- Two sessions now show consistent reflection about "harder than expected" - this is valuable pattern data for future workshop planning
