## Sailing Orders

### Plotted (Underway)

| Order | Deadline | Created | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Workshop 1 Content Preparation | 2026-02-03 | 2026-01-21 | Content must be finalized before posting |

- Git/GitHub basics content
- Concept: Focus on "why" rather than command usage
  - AI can handle commands → understanding concepts/rules is key
  - Use cases, why companies require this
  - Analogy: "Ever played a game with someone who doesn't know the rules?" → Must know Git rules to collaborate
- Approach: Question-based (Socratic method) - Question → Discussion → Concept → Hands-on
- Hands-on environment setup (practice with constrained repo):
  - Branch Protection Rules: No direct push to main, PR required, Review approval required, CI must pass to merge
  - Commit Convention: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.), Commitlint + Husky for format enforcement
  - PR template required
- Format: Course Outline focused (PPT/Thumbnail generated by AI)
- Use table: Topic → Sub-topic → Outcome → Associated concepts
