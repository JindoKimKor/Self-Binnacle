> <details>
> <summary>Details</summary>
>
> - Git/GitHub basics content
> - Concept: Focus on "why" rather than command usage
>   - AI can handle commands → understanding concepts/rules is key
>   - Use cases, why companies require this
>   - Analogy: "Ever played a game with someone who doesn't know the rules?" → Must know Git rules to collaborate
> - Approach: Question-based (Socratic method) - Question → Discussion → Concept → Hands-on
> - Hands-on environment setup (practice with constrained repo):
>   - Branch Protection Rules: No direct push to main, PR required, Review approval required, CI must pass to merge
>   - Commit Convention: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.), Commitlint + Husky for format enforcement
>   - PR template required
> - Format: Course Outline focused (PPT/Thumbnail generated by AI)
> - Use table: Topic → Sub-topic → Outcome → Associated concepts
