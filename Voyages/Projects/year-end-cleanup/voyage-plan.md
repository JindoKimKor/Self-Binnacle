## Why
Bring all unorganized materials since 2023 into Self-Binnacle, or at least learn a method to organize unstructured data. Want all accumulated resources to be integrated into this system and utilized effectively.

## What
What is this voyage about? (Scope, Background, Context, Problem Statement, Definition, etc.)

Knowledge, files, and folders are unmanaged across multiple workspaces. Needs organization.
- Discord
- Obsidian
- OneDrive
- Miro diagrams
- Browser tab groups
- GitHub repos
- Google Docs
- Download folder
- Desktop
- Confluence

## How
How will I accomplish this? (Workflow, Process, Schedule, etc.)

Steps:
- Watch resource video and define what needs to be done
- Start by going through everything and deleting what's not needed
- List all places where knowledge is currently scattered
    - Create a list of what knowledge/data exists for organization
- Decide organization direction
- Execute actual cleanup
