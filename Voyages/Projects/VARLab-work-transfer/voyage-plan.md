title: "[Project] VARLab Work Transfer"
created: 2026-01-07
deadline: TBD
---

## Why
Transfer all VARLab work (code, documentation, PR records, presentations) to personal ownership with proper git history attribution, preserving professional achievements and learnings.

## What
- Transfer 4 repositories with git history (email changed to personal)
- Organize 8+ project achievements into legs/
- Collect all documentation, PR records, demo materials

### Repositories
| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| devops-jenkins-linux | Linux pipeline, 4-layer architecture, Docker optimization |
| devops-jenkins-windows | Unity build server, Windows Docker, WebGL deploy |
| dlx-hosting-server-moodle | LTI integration (Moodle), CIS compliance |
| dlx-hosting-server-d2l | LTI integration (D2L), CIS compliance |

### Legs (Achievements)
| Leg | Related Repo | Key Achievement |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| devops-pipeline | devops-jenkins-linux | 4-layer architecture, 37% duplication resolved |
| devops-logging | devops-jenkins-linux | 3-level execution pattern, standardized logging |
| linux-migration | devops-jenkins-linux | 93% faster Docker, 73→3 vulnerabilities |
| unity-cloud-migration | devops-jenkins-linux | 94.88% cost reduction |
| unity-build-server | devops-jenkins-windows | 80% faster, 90% CPU reduction |
| unity-webgl-deploy | devops-jenkins-windows | 20-30 min saved per review |
| web-cicd | devops-jenkins-linux | 80% code coverage enabled |
| lti-integration | dlx-hosting-server-moodle/d2l | LMS integration, CIS compliance |
| azure-vm-docker | devops-jenkins-windows | Nested virtualization, Windows Docker |

## How
1. Change git author email (filter-branch)
2. Push to personal GitHub (private)
3. Organize documentation/PR/presentations into legs/
4. Write README.md for each leg (learnings, time spent, impact)
