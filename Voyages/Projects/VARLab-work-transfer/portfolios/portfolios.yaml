    title: "Retrospective Analysis: From 5 Monolithic pipeline to 4-Layer Pipeline"
    labels:
      What I did: "Transformed 5 monolithic pipelines (37% duplication) into 4-layer architecture with centralized libraries"
      How it emerged: "Felt the pain → organized by domain naturally → patterns emerged"
      Post-analysis: "Mapped my solution to industry concepts (Software Smells, DDD patterns, GoF Design Patterns)"
      Documentation: "Problem analysis, pattern identification, architecture rationale"

    title: "94.88% CI/CD Infrastructure Cost Reduction"
    labels:
      Context: "Unity CI/CD build environment isolation at VARLab"
      Problem: "Unity Editor 100% CPU usage → server crashes on concurrent builds"
      Solution: "Azure Batch + Spot VMs for on-demand execution"
      Result: "94.88% cost reduction ($618 → $32 for 56 days)"
      Keywords: "Azure Batch, Spot VMs, Docker, Unity, Cost Optimization"

    title: "Stabilized Crashed Unity Build Server"
    labels:
      Context: "Unity CI/CD server stability crisis (June 2024)"
      Problem: "VM crashes when 2-3 pipelines run simultaneously"
      Solution: "Trade-off approach - shared project files + optimization skip"
      Result: "Server stabilized, concurrent pipelines supported"
      Byproduct: "80% faster builds, 90% CPU reduction"
