At VARLab, I served as Cloud/DevOps Engineer for an educational technology research lab. My primary focus was working on CI/CD infrastructure for Unity game development, web-based educational simulations, and Node.js web applications. I worked extensively with Jenkins, Azure cloud services, Docker containerization, and LMS platform integrations (Moodle, D2L). Over 15 months, I tackled accumulated technical debt, optimized cloud costs, and established reliable automation systems that enabled both game development and web development teams to deliver faster and more safely.

At Affinity Mentorship Foundation, I developed their website from scratch using React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Express.js. I implemented a modular, component-based architecture to ensure the codebase was reusable and maintainable for future volunteers. I also created a YouTube tutorial on Azure DevOps Boards to help the team adopt Agile practices, improving collaboration and project tracking.

At Pilot Things, I built an integration service layer connecting their IoT platform with Thingsboard, an open-source visualization and analytics platform. Using Java and Spring Boot, I implemented the Adapter pattern to wrap Thingsboard's REST APIs with a clean Model-Service-Interface architecture. I also created comprehensive integration tests to validate API compatibility with Thingsboard's Role-Based Access Control system, achieving 100% successful data delivery and operation verification.
