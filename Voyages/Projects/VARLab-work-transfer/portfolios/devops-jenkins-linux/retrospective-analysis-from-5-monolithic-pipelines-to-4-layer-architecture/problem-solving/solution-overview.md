## 1. Background

### 1.1 Purpose

This documentation is a **post-refactoring analysis** of intuitive problem-solving done during VARLab Co-op.

| What I Did | What This Document Does |
|------------|------------------------|
| Refactored 5 monolithic pipelines into 4-Layer Architecture | Classify and define those intuitive fixes using industry conventions |
| Designed 3-Level Logger System | Analyze why the design worked and how it integrates with the architecture |

**Goal:** Transform experience-based understanding into systematic, reusable knowledge

- Learn how problems I "felt" are formally named and classified
- Validate solutions against established principles (Design Patterns, DDD)
- Understand integration points that made the architecture work

## 2. Reference Commits

| State | Commit Hash | Date |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Before (Baseline)** | [`74fc356`](https://github.com/JindoKimKor/devops-jenkins-linux/tree/74fc3563713df593f070f1c418ef9ee68f2682ed) | 2025-03-20 |
| **After (Final)** | [`ff74ac8`](https://github.com/JindoKimKor/devops-jenkins-linux/tree/ff74ac8) | 2025-05-12 |

**Duration:** 54 days (Library setup 35 days, Core refactoring ~2 weeks)

## 3. Applied Industry Conventions

### 3.1 Design Patterns (GoF)

Patterns identified in the refactored architecture:

| Pattern | Where Applied | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Command** | GitLibrary, ShellLibrary, SSHShellLibrary | Encapsulate shell commands as Closure objects |
| **Facade** | logger, shellScriptHelper | Hide Jenkins DSL complexity behind simple API |
| **Adapter** | shellScriptHelper | Convert (Closure, args) → Map for Jenkins sh() |

**Data Source:** [solution-by-layer.md Section 4](solution-by-layer.md#4-design-patterns-applied)

### 3.2 DDD Concepts

Post-refactoring analysis found alignment with some DDD organizational principles:

| Pattern | Alignment | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Layered Architecture** | ✓ Applied | 4-layer separation (Entry → Orchestration → Infrastructure → Module) |
| **Modules** | ✓ Applied | GitLibrary, ShellLibrary, SSHShellLibrary as cohesive units |
| **Infrastructure Service** | Partial | Concept exists, implemented as GoF Facade |

Not a full DDD implementation due to stateless pipeline environment.
