## 4. New Stage Files (vars/)

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| stageInitialization.groovy | 102 | Jenkins environment initialization, environment variable setup |
| stageProjectPrepare.groovy | 115 | Git clone/checkout, branch synchronization, LFS |
| stageLintGroovyJenkinsfile.groovy | 96 | Groovy/Jenkinsfile static analysis (npm-groovy-lint) |
| stageLintUnity.groovy | 67 | Unity C# linting (Rider batch mode) |
| stageStaticAnalysis.groovy | 44 | SonarQube static code analysis |
| stageUnityExecution.groovy | 98 | Unity EditMode/PlayMode/Coverage tests |
| stageDeployBuild.groovy | 72 | WebGL build and deployment |
| stageCleanupPRBranchArtifacts.groovy | 55 | PR artifact cleanup after merge |
| stageSendBuildResults.groovy | 31 | Send Bitbucket build status |

## 5. New Libraries

### 5.1 `sharedLibraries/src/utils/SSHShellLibrary.groovy` (99 lines)
SSH command library (for WebGL deployment)
```groovy
class SSHShellLibrary {
    // SSH connection check
    static Closure CHECK_SSH_CONNECTIVITY = { host, user, keyPath ->
        "ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 -i ${keyPath} ${user}@${host} 'echo ok'"
    }

    // Create remote directory
    static Closure SSH_CREATE_REMOTE_DIR = { host, user, keyPath, remotePath ->
        "ssh -i ${keyPath} ${user}@${host} 'mkdir -p ${remotePath}'"
    }

    // SCP file transfer
    static Closure SCP_COPY_TO_REMOTE = { localPath, host, user, keyPath, remotePath ->
        "scp -r -i ${keyPath} ${localPath} ${user}@${host}:${remotePath}"
    }

    // Delete remote directory
    static Closure SSH_REMOVE_REMOTE_DIR = { host, user, keyPath, remotePath ->
        "ssh -i ${keyPath} ${user}@${host} 'rm -rf ${remotePath}'"
    }
}
```

## 6. Jenkinsfile Transformation Example

### 6.1 Before (DLXJenkins/Jenkinsfile)
```groovy
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Prepare WORKSPACE') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // 50 lines of Git checkout logic
                    // 20 lines of environment variable setup
                    // 30 lines of error handling
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Linting') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // 40 lines of linting logic
                }
            }
        }
        // ... more stages
    }
}
```

### 6.2 After (DLXJenkins/Jenkinsfile)
```groovy
@Library('global-trusted-shared-library@main') _

pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Initialization') {
            steps {
                stageInitialization()
            }
        }
        stage('Project Preparation') {
            steps {
                stageProjectPrepare()
            }
        }
        stage('Linting') {
            steps {
                stageLintUnity()
            }
        }
        stage('EditMode Tests') {
            steps {
                stageUnityExecution(testType: 'EditMode')
            }
        }
        stage('PlayMode Tests') {
            steps {
                stageUnityExecution(testType: 'PlayMode')
            }
        }
        stage('Build WebGL') {
            steps {
                stageDeployBuild(buildType: 'WebGL')
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            stageSendBuildResults()
        }
    }
}
```

## 7. Webhook Configuration Improvements

### 7.1 PullRequest vs Repo:Push Event Separation
```groovy
triggers {
    GenericTrigger(
        genericVariables: [
            [key: 'BITBUCKET_EVENT_KEY', value: '$.headers.x-event-key']
        ],
        regexpFilterExpression: '^pullrequest:.*',
        regexpFilterText: '$BITBUCKET_EVENT_KEY'
    )
}
```

### 7.2 Dynamic Environment Variable Assignment
```groovy
// PR event
if (env.BITBUCKET_EVENT_KEY.startsWith('pullrequest:')) {
    env.PR_BRANCH = env.BITBUCKET_SOURCE_BRANCH
    env.DESTINATION_BRANCH = env.BITBUCKET_DESTINATION_BRANCH
}
// Push event
else if (env.BITBUCKET_EVENT_KEY == 'repo:push') {
    env.PR_BRANCH = env.GIT_BRANCH.replaceFirst('origin/', '')
    env.DESTINATION_BRANCH = 'main'
}
```

```

## 9. Benefits

### 9.1 Code Reuse
- 5 pipelines use same Stage files
- Duplicate code removed

### 9.2 Easy Maintenance
- Modify only one file when changing Stage logic
- Jenkinsfile only defines pipeline structure

### 9.3 Improved Readability
- Jenkinsfile reads like a table of contents
- Clear role for each Stage

### 9.4 Testability
- Each Stage file can be tested independently
- Library functions can be unit tested

### 9.5 Consistent Logging
- All Stages use logger
- Standardized output format

## 10. Conclusion

**5 monolithic pipelines** → **4-Layer Architecture + Centralized Library**

- Jenkinsfile code volume reduced by approximately **70-78%**
- **12 reusable Stage modules** created
- **3 Shell libraries** (Git, Shell, SSH)
- **1 API service** (Bitbucket)
- **3-Level Logger** standard interface
