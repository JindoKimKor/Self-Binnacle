## Forecast Review

### Time
- **Forecast**: 4 hours
- **Actual**: 65.5 hours (7 days)
- **Variance**: 16x over (+1,537.5%)
- **Was it accurate?**: No. Highly inaccurate.
- **Why?**:
  1. Underestimated as "documentation work" → actually was analysis + structuring + verification
  2. SRP analysis criteria didn't fit Jenkins/Procedural Code, causing rework
  3. Testability section required complete restructuring, not just addition

### Difficulty
- **Forecast**: Easy-Medium
- **Actual**: Medium-Hard
- **Was it accurate?**: Partially accurate (Medium part only)
- **Why?**:
  - Software Design concepts themselves were familiar (Easy part)
  - But had to reinterpret for Jenkins/Procedural Code context (Hard part)
  - Discovered that applicable Smells differ between OOP vs Procedural
  - Portfolio-wide verification required more attention than expected

### How can I forecast better next time? (Metacognition)

#### 1. Categorize Work Types
- Don't lump everything as "documentation" - break it down:
  - Simple writing (1x)
  - Writing after analysis (3x)
  - Writing after structural redesign (5x)
  - Including verification (+2x)

#### 2. Recognize Uncertainty
- Even "familiar content" may require rework when applying to new context (Jenkins DSL)
- Define or limit scope expansion possibilities upfront

#### 3. Time Buffer
- Apply minimum 3x buffer for complex documentation work
- Plan verification phase as separate time allocation

#### 4. Future Estimation Criteria for Similar Work
- Portfolio-level documentation: Expect minimum 40-60 hours
- When including analysis + structuring + verification: Apply 10-15x base estimate
