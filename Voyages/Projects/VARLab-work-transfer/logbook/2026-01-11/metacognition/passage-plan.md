## Passage Plan (Planning)

### Task
Complete baseline code analysis for each file in `problem-analysis/` folder by topic.

### Time Estimate
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Reasoning**:
  - 10 files in `problem-analysis/` cover clear Software Design topics (SOLID, DRY, God Object, etc.)
  - Familiar with AI usage for efficient progress
  - However, significant content may take time

### Difficulty Estimate
- **Estimate**: Easy-Medium
- **Reasoning**:
  - Good understanding of Software Design aspects
  - Already reviewed this content 5+ times, so familiar
  - But documentation workload puts it at medium difficulty
