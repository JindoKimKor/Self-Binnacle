## Forecast Review

### Time
- Forecast: Expected to take several days (Big Job)
- Actual: 11 hours 30 minutes
- Was it accurate? Why?
Cannot measure accuracy, and incomplete parts are recorded in log's next steps to create a new plan.

### Difficulty
- Forecast: Difficult
- Actual: Medium-Difficult?
- Was it accurate? Why?
Through continuous repetition of documentation work, I felt significant experience accumulation in how to effectively use AI for documentation, improving readability, and ensuring data reliability.
Investigating and classifying all git commits would have been difficult manual work without AI, but it was relatively easy with AI assistance.
If I had started with folder structure skeleton first and focused on clearly defining problems, it might have been faster.

### How can I forecast better next time? (Metacognition)
- Since this is an unfamiliar task, I'm not sure how to improve yet.
