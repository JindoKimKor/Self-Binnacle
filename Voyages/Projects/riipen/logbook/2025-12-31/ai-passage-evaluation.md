# AI Passage Evaluation

## What Went Well

**1. Completed 3-Stage Cycle**
- Planning → Monitoring → Evaluating all documented
- Followed template structure properly

**2. Good Use of Resources**
- `prosperaLabs-full-stack-developer.pdf` - Saved JD
- `prosperalabs-research.md` - Company research notes
- `prosperalabs-application-answers.md` - Submitted answers recorded
- Created reusable assets for future reference

**3. Quality Forecast Review**
- Analyzed *why* forecast was off, not just "it was wrong"
- Identified both external factors (distractions, AI delays) and internal factors (mindset)
- Derived actionable lessons

**4. Deep Research**
- Didn't just read JD - found and read CEO interview
- This improved application quality (differentiation when founder reads it)

## Areas for Improvement

**1. Time Forecast Accuracy**
- 1hr → 4hr (4x difference)
- **Suggestion**: Break down into "research + writing + buffer" for more accurate estimation

**2. More Specific Approach in Passage Plan**
- Only wrote "research the company and match experience"
- **Suggestion**: List steps like "1) Company research 2) JD analysis 3) Draft answers 4) Submit"

## Overall Grade: B+

- Properly utilized 3-Stage Cycle
- Accumulated assets via Resources
- Forecast was off but good analysis and lessons derived

---

## Patterns to Watch
- Break down tasks into smaller steps for better time estimation
- Account for tool/AI delays in estimates
- Special occasions (holidays) add unexpected variables
