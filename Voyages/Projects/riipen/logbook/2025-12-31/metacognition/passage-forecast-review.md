## Forecast Review

### Time
- Forecast: 1 hour
- Actual: 4 hours
- Was it accurate? Why?
  - Could not focus consistently - many distractions (New Year's Eve party prep, helping others, Helprr tasks)
  - AI research took unexpectedly long due to some operational issues - had to wait
  - However, once research was done, matching my experience to requirements went quickly with AI assistance

### Difficulty
- Forecast: Medium
- Actual: Easy~Medium
- Was it accurate? Why?
  - Easier than expected once I accepted that I can't control the outcome
  - Framed my limited full-stack experience honestly (learned in school, backend-focused professionally)
  - Letting go of "what if I get rejected" mindset made the process smoother

### How can I forecast better next time?
- New Year's Eve had many unexpected variables - maybe avoid forecasting on special occasions?
- Account for potential AI tool delays/issues in time estimates
