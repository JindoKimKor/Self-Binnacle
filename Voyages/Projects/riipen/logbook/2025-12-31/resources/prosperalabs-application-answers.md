## What unique skills/experiences do you believe sets you apart to make you a strong fit for this project?

**Startup Experience:**
Currently working as Backend Lead at Helprr.ai, an early-stage AI startup. I understand the fast-paced environment, wearing multiple hats, and the need for quick iteration.

**Full-Stack Perspective:**
When development stalled at Helprr.ai, I created a unified API contract documentation that included wireframes and use cases. This enabled PM, frontend, and backend teams to collaborate effectively and move the project forward. I can bridge different roles and unblock development when needed.

**End-to-End Experience and Architectural Thinking:**
At VARLab, I analyzed business logic patterns and successfully transformed the entire codebase into testable, reusable, and maintainable code through architectural restructuring. I understand how to see the complete picture and design systems that scale.

## How does this project—or the industry it represents—align with your career goals?

I've learned full-stack development through my college program and have deep backend experience from Helprr.ai and VARLab. At Helprr.ai, when designing API contracts, I also considered frontend state management to ensure seamless integration. This project offers the opportunity to work hands-on across Python backend and React frontend. The AI Agent industry is where I want to build my career, and this project would give me practical experience in that space.
