- Drafted and refined application answers with AI assistance
- Submitted project application

### Notes
- Took longer than expected because I wanted to understand the company deeply before applying
- Reading the CEO interview helped craft a more personalized application - mentioned his vision of moving from "AI that answers questions" to "AI that gets work done"
