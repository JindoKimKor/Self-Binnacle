## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Reapplied to FuturePath after being eliminated from previous cohort
- Wrote and submitted short bio (241 words)

#### Open-ended question
Write a short bio (200–250 words) that you can use on your Riipen profile and tell us about *
- Who you are and what you are interested in
- How a FuturePath project fits into your goals
- What sets you apart and why would an employer be excited to have you on their project?

Please note this is the only open-ended question so take your time and tell us your story!

#### Submitted Bio
I'm a third-year Computer Programming and Analysis student at Conestoga College with a passion for solving problems through software. My approach starts with understanding how different stakeholders think and interact, then designing systems that connect them seamlessly. A FuturePath project fits my goals because it provides real-world problem-solving opportunities, and this kind of hands-on experience is invaluable for growth as a developer. What sets me apart is my track record of delivering measurable results. At VARLab, I resolved 14-month technical debt by transforming legacy pipelines into a testable architecture, achieved 94.88% cost reduction in infrastructure, and stabilized a crashed build server with 80% faster builds. At Helprr.ai, I led cross-functional collaboration by creating documentation that aligned technical and non-technical stakeholders, unblocking stalled development. I bring both technical depth in CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and full-stack development, as well as the soft skills to bridge communication gaps between teams. My military experience as a Deputy Platoon Leader taught me to coordinate diverse teams under pressure and adapt to different leadership styles. Employers would be excited to have me because I don't just write code. I identify root causes, design sustainable solutions, and document everything so the team can maintain it. I'm looking for a project where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow.
