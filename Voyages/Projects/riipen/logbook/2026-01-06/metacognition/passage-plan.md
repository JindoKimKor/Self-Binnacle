## Passage Plan (Planning)

### Task
- What will I do? (including approach)
Got eliminated from the previous cohort because I wasn't matched, received email to reapply.
Need to fill out application again, including writing a short bio.

### Time Estimate
- How long will it take? 30 min?
- Why do I think so? Plan to draft in Korean based on given objectives, then translate to English with AI help. Should be manageable.

### Difficulty Estimate
- How well can I do this? Medium
- Why do I think so? (including expected obstacles)
Writing these kinds of bios is always challenging.
