## Forecast Review

### Time
- Forecast: 30 min
- Actual: 30 min or less
- Was it accurate? Why? Was able to write quickly using accumulated records in Self-Binnacle, my Resume, and AI assistance.

### Difficulty
- Forecast: Medium
- Actual: Easy
- Was it accurate? Why? Already had accumulated data, so submitting was quick using AI based on that.

### How can I forecast better next time? (Metacognition)
- This kind of submission task feels tedious and annoying. The content itself isn't that hard to write, but if I wanted to write something I'm truly satisfied with, it would probably feel more like Medium difficulty.
