## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?

**New project analysis: Butter Web Design - AI-Powered SMS Customer Support Agent**

1. Read Riipen PDF, matched skills against resume, created full analysis doc
2. Researched company: butterwebdesign.com + Ryan Lowe LinkedIn
3. Identified two-level problem: immediate (lead response time) + strategic (web design → AI SaaS pivot)
4. Deep dive into how the system actually works: quote form → webhook → AI SMS conversation → calendar booking
5. Analyzed build vs off-the-shelf approaches, recommended OpenAI API + Twilio (development value + low cost)
6. Verified 31 portfolio clients from butterwebdesign.com across 11 industry categories
7. Researched platform pricing (Twilio, OpenAI, GoHighLevel, Retell AI, Sendbird)
8. Drafted Q1-Q3 + Introduction Message, iterated through multiple feedback rounds
9. Submitted application

**Other projects evaluated:**
- PhonoLogic QA Challenge: already analyzed (2026-02-20), moderate fit, backup option
- Evolve Solar Teardrops: evaluated and passed (Webflow web design, no backend/AI)

### File Changes (2026-02-23)

| Timestamp | File | What Changed |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 15:28 | `resources/Riipen _ AI-Powered SMS Customer Support Agent.pdf` | Downloaded Riipen project listing PDF |
| 15:58 | `resources/Web Design Portfolio _ Butter Web Design.pdf` | Downloaded portfolio PDF (34MB, 35 pages) for client verification |
| ~16:00 | `resources/portfolio-screenshots/` | Extracted portfolio page images (page_4.png - page_34.png) for visual verification |
| 16:53 | `resources/Butter-Web-Design.md` | Created and iteratively refined: company research, fit analysis, Q1-Q3 drafts, Intro Message, Deep Dive section (user flow, why SMS/AI, modules, build vs off-the-shelf, platform costs, verified clients) |
| 16:56 | `resources/Riipen _ Evolve Solar Teardrops...pdf` | Downloaded for evaluation (passed) |

### Key Decisions Made
- **OpenAI + Twilio over GoHighLevel:** Enough real coding for portfolio value, near-zero dev cost ($15-30), 60hr feasible
- **Removed Unity CI Enabler from Q2:** Too tangential, domain too different from SMS agent
- **Removed Self-Binnacle from Q1:** Overexplain for a time management question
- **Removed scale numbers from gilJOBi (Q2):** 123K records / 90% accuracy irrelevant for SMS agent; focused on "LLM behaving reliably in a real system"
- **Split Intro vs Q3 angles:** Intro = Ryan's problem (lead response time) + approach; Q3 = multi-industry learning opportunity
- **"businesses" over "websites":** Better frames Ryan's relationship with his clients

### Blockers

### Reflection
-

### Next Steps
- Wait for Butter Web Design response from Ryan
- If matched with Butter: confirm tech stack preferences, discuss platform costs with Ryan

### Notes
- Butter Web Design is strongest fit so far: actual development work + AI integration + reusable architecture
- Ryan is front-end designer, not developer. Answers should propose approach, not wait for instructions
- "or help implement an off-the-shelf solution" in PD = HOW is open, not prescriptive
- Riipen Mentorship section is default boilerplate, not project-specific signal
