## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Auto-assigned to **Team 48** for Jill Hewlett Inc. project
- Reviewed project brief and deliverable template
- Reviewed project roadmap/milestones
- **Sent reassignment request email to labs@riipen.com** - requested technical project or withdrawal

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
- Not a technical project (business strategy/market research) - doesn't align with my career goals
- 3 months until graduation - time better spent on job search and technical prep
- $300 payment not worth 3 weeks of non-relevant work
- Decision: Request reassignment to technical project, or withdraw

### Next Steps
- [ ] Wait for Riipen response
- [ ] If technical project available → proceed
- [ ] If not → withdraw and focus on job search
