## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Researched 4 Riipen FuturePath projects: MyHelpr, Kreative Retail Solutions, Esty, Molded Fortitude Consulting
- Created detailed resource docs for each project (company overview, project details, payment, fit analysis)
- Eliminated 2 projects: Esty (Montréal location restriction), Molded Fortitude (marketing/sales, not engineering)
- Applied to MyHelpr (14:52) — backend refactoring + AI platform optimization
- Applied to Kreative Retail Solutions (15:03) — website-POS integration

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
-

### Next Steps
- Wait for responses from MyHelpr and Kreative Retail Solutions
- If MyHelpr responds: confirm tech stack, matching engine implementation, and codebase state (Pre-Join Checklist)

### References
- MyHelpr: ../../resources/myhelpr/MyHelpr.md
- Kreative Retail Solutions: ../../resources/kreative-retail-solutions/Kreative-Retail-Solutions.md
- Esty (PASS): ../../resources/esty/Esty.md
- Molded Fortitude (PASS): ../../resources/molded-fortitude/Molded-Fortitude-Consulting.md

### Notes
- MyHelpr is the strongest match (backend refactoring + scalability + Helprr.ai domain overlap)
- Kreative Retail is moderate backup (API integration pattern transfers)

### Raw (AI: organize into sections above)
