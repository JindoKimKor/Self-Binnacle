## Fit Analysis (vs. My Experience)

### Required Skills Match

| Required Skill | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Web Development** | Moderate | React.js + Express.js (Affinity Mentorship) — but no sales funnel / marketing site experience |
| **Database Management** | Moderate | Worked across MongoDB, MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL — but not data repository optimization |
| **Scalability** | Strong | VARLab: on-demand cloud provisioning, modular architecture for scalability |
| **Data Management** | Weak | No direct data pipeline / data repository experience |
| **Sales Process / Lead Gen** | None | No experience in sales funnels, CRM, or lead conversion |

### Focus Area Match

| Project Focus | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Sales funnel development** | Weak | No marketing/sales funnel experience — this is more marketing-tech than software engineering |
| **Data repository optimization** | Partial | Database experience exists, but not in data repository production/accessibility context |
| **Website redesign** | Moderate | Built website from scratch (Affinity Mentorship) — but not conversion-focused design |
| **UX improvement** | Weak | Backend-focused profile, minimal UX/design experience |

### Strengths for This Role

- Scalability expertise transfers to building scalable data systems
- Documentation and reporting deliverables align with my track record
- 300 hours / $7,002 — good compensation with Intermediate level barrier
- Anywhere location — no geographic restriction

### Gaps to Address

- **Sales/Marketing tech**: Sales funnels, lead capture, conversion optimization — entirely outside my domain
- **Frontend/UX heavy**: Project is more about user-facing design and conversion than backend systems
- **Data repositories**: Vague scope — could mean anything from CRM setup to database restructuring
- **Consulting domain**: Wellness/coaching industry has specific marketing patterns I'm unfamiliar with

### Overall Assessment

**Weak fit.** Despite good compensation (300 hrs, $7,002) and no location restriction, this project is fundamentally about **marketing tech and sales optimization** — not software engineering. The "web development" here means conversion-focused website design, not the backend/infrastructure work where my strengths lie. The vague scope ("data management", "sales process") suggests a business-tool integration project rather than a technical engineering challenge.
