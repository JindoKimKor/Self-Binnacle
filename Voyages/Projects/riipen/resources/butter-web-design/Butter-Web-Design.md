## Company Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company** | [Butter Web Design](https://butterwebdesign.com/) / [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/company/butter-web-design) |
| **Location** | Stella / Peterborough, Ontario, Canada |
| **Size** | 2 - 10 employees |
| **Industry** | Construction, Government, Hospital/Health/Wellness, Insurance |
| **Owner** | Ryan Lowe (front-end web designer, freeCodeCamp Full Stack cert 2017-2018) |
| **Previous** | Site Hive Web Design & Strategy, Big Bang Gravity, Zzapp Design |
| **Recognition** | Peterborough's Best Web Designer, 5 consecutive years |

**Core business (since 2010):** Building and maintaining websites for local SMBs in Peterborough, Kingston, and Southern Ontario. Services include web design, graphic design/branding, website maintenance, and ongoing support.

**Strategic pivot:** Expanding from web design into SaaS AI productivity, agent deployment (and ongoing upkeep), AI audits, AI consulting. This project is the first step in that pivot.

### What Problem Are They Actually Solving?

**Level 1: Immediate (Lead Response Time)**
Ryan's clients have quote forms on their websites. When a prospect submits a form, there's a delay before a human responds. The lead goes cold. An AI SMS agent provides instant, intelligent responses and books discovery calls automatically.

**Level 2: Strategic (Business Model Pivot)**
Ryan is a front-end designer, not an AI engineer. He wants to move up the value chain:
- **Current model:** "We build your website" (one-time project fee)
- **Target model:** "We build your website + deploy AI agents + maintain them" (recurring revenue)

The "deployable across client websites" deliverable is the key. This isn't just one SMS bot for Butter Web Design. It's a **reusable AI agent product** Ryan can offer to all his existing clients. The Riipen student builds the template; Ryan deploys it across his client base.

**Ryan's gap:** He has the client relationships and web design skills, but zero AI/ML/backend capability to build this himself. That's what the Riipen project fills.

## Fit Analysis (vs. My Experience)

### Required Skills Match

| Required Skill | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Agents** | ✅ Used | gilJOBi — LLM integration pipeline (Claude CLI + Apache Spark); built working AI processing system |
| **NLP** | ⚠️ Adjacent | gilJOBi — job title normalization with ~90% accuracy against DOL taxonomy; LLM-based, not traditional NLP |
| **Machine Learning** | ⚠️ Adjacent | gilJOBi — LLM integration; but no traditional ML model training/evaluation |
| **Algorithms** | ✅ Used | General — data processing pipeline design, distributed systems |
| **Communication** | ✅ Strong | Helprr.ai — team lead, unified spec format; ROK Army — coordinated 120 personnel |
| **Performance Metrics** | ✅ Strong | VARLab — 94.88% cost reduction, 80% faster builds, 90% CPU reduction; documented impact quantitatively |
| **Sales Process** | ❌ Gap | No sales domain experience |
| **Sales Prospecting** | ❌ Gap | No prospecting or lead conversion experience |
| **Customer Support** | ❌ Gap | No customer support automation experience |
| **SMS Platform Integration** | ❌ Gap | No Twilio/SMS API experience |

### Key Observation

The project description includes: **"or help implement an off-the-shelf solution."** This is critical — it reframes the project from "build NLP/ML from scratch" to potentially "evaluate, configure, and integrate an existing AI tool." This dramatically changes the skill match.

### If Off-the-Shelf Approach (More Likely)

| Actual Task | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Evaluate & select AI/SMS tools** | Strong | gilJOBi — evaluated and integrated LLM tools into production pipeline |
| **API integration (SMS platform)** | Strong | Pilot Things — Adapter pattern wrapping Thingsboard APIs; Helprr.ai — API contract design |
| **System integration & testing** | Strong | VARLab — end-to-end pipeline ownership, testing infrastructure from scratch |
| **Documentation & user guide** | Strong | Helprr.ai — unified feature specification; VARLab — 3-level logging documentation |
| **Reusable/deployable across clients** | Strong | VARLab — centralized library architecture, modular design for reuse |

### Strengths for This Role

- **LLM integration is directly relevant** — modern "AI agents" are LLM-powered (GPT, Claude), not traditional NLP/ML. gilJOBi experience maps directly.
- **API integration pattern** — Pilot Things Adapter pattern experience is exactly what SMS platform integration requires (wrapping Twilio/similar APIs)
- **"Deployable across client websites" deliverable** — matches VARLab centralized library approach (build once, reuse across environments)
- **Documentation deliverables** — proven track record of technical documentation (Helprr.ai unified spec, VARLab logging system)
- **Small team comfort** — Helprr.ai (startup), VARLab (lab team) both match 2-10 employee environment
- **Mentorship is comprehensive** — domain expertise + hands-on support reduces risk of unfamiliar sales domain

### Gaps to Address

- **Sales/prospecting domain** — zero experience. Must frame as "technically capable of building the tool, learning the domain through mentorship"
- **SMS platform specifics** — no Twilio/Vonage/etc. experience, but API integration pattern transfers
- **Customer support automation** — no prior chatbot or automated messaging experience
- **NLP/ML if custom build** — if they want traditional NLP training, this becomes a significant gap

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Project requires custom ML model training | Low | Description says "or off-the-shelf"; mentor provides hands-on support |
| Sales domain knowledge needed for agent quality | Medium | Mentor provides domain expertise; Ryan likely has scripts/FAQ to train from |
| SMS platform integration complexity | Low | Standard API integration; well-documented platforms (Twilio, etc.) |
| Scope creep beyond 60 hrs | Medium | Clear deliverables defined; 15 hrs/invoice pacing |

### Overall Assessment

**Moderate-to-good fit, especially if off-the-shelf approach.** The project's core technical challenge — integrating an AI agent with SMS platforms and making it reusable across client websites — aligns well with API integration, system design, and documentation skills. The LLM integration experience from gilJOBi is directly relevant since modern AI agents are LLM-powered, not traditional NLP/ML.

The main weakness is the sales/customer support domain, but the comprehensive mentorship (domain expertise + hands-on support) is designed to bridge exactly this gap. The "off-the-shelf solution" option significantly lowers the technical barrier.

**Compare to MyHelpr:** MyHelpr was a stronger technical fit (backend refactoring, scalability). This project is more AI-agent-focused but has lower technical risk due to the off-the-shelf option and comprehensive mentorship.

## Application Guidance

### Q1: How do you plan to manage your time and contribute approximately 8-10 hours per week to this project?

**Key points to cover:**

- Final semester at Conestoga (graduating April 2026), lighter course load
- Structured time management system (Google Calendar + personal management system)
- 60 hrs over the project period is sustainable at 8-10 hrs/week
- Can dedicate consistent blocks — not sporadic availability
- Experience managing concurrent commitments (VARLab co-op, Helprr.ai, coursework)

**Draft:**

> I'm in my final semester with a lighter course load, so I have consistent availability. I've been balancing multiple commitments at the same time throughout school (side projects, a startup, and coursework), so dedicating 8-10 hours per week to this project is realistic for me.

---

### Q2: What unique skills/experiences do you believe sets you apart to make you a strong fit for this project?

**Key points to cover:**

- **gilJOBi (Capstone) = direct AI integration experience** — not theoretical, actually built a working LLM pipeline that processes real data
- **API integration pattern** — Pilot Things Adapter pattern for wrapping external APIs translates directly to SMS platform integration
- **"Reusable across client websites" deliverable** — VARLab centralized library architecture is the same pattern (build once, deploy many)
- **Documentation track record** — the user guide deliverable matches Helprr.ai's unified specification format experience
- Show you understand the real problem: not just one bot, but a reusable product for Ryan's client base
- Don't oversell AI/ML — be honest about the integration angle

**Draft:**

> **LLM integration:** For my Capstone project (gilJOBi), I integrated Claude's LLM into a working data pipeline, handling prompt design, response parsing, and edge cases in production data. That experience of getting an LLM to behave reliably inside a real system is directly relevant to building an AI SMS agent.
>
> **Third-party API integration:** I've been working with external APIs consistently across my projects: integrating Bitbucket and Azure APIs into pipelines at VARLab, wrapping Thingsboard APIs through an Adapter pattern at Pilot Things, and designing API contracts at Helprr.ai. Connecting to an SMS platform like Twilio would follow the same pattern.
>
> **Reusable architecture:** The "deployable across client websites" deliverable is a pattern I've worked with before. At VARLab, I designed a centralized library architecture so pipeline solutions could be reused across different build environments without rebuilding each time.

### Q3: How does this project — or the industry it represents — align with your career goals?

**Key points to cover:**

- This question is really: "Do you understand what we're trying to do?"
- Show you see the bigger picture: deploying across multiple domains
- The real career value: learning to adapt AI to different industries (construction, healthcare, insurance...)
- Building an AI agent that works well in ONE domain is easy. Making it work across MANY domains requires understanding each one. That's the learning opportunity.
- Keep the ratio ~60% about their business, ~40% about your goals

**Draft:**

> What stood out to me is that this project isn't just about building one SMS bot. You're serving clients across construction, healthcare, insurance, and other industries, and the "reusable solution" requirement means the AI agent needs to work naturally in each of those contexts. That's a real challenge: an agent that sounds right for a roofing company needs different knowledge than one for a dental clinic. For me, that's exactly the kind of experience I'm looking for. After graduation I'm heading into backend and infrastructure roles where AI integration is becoming essential, and learning how to adapt AI systems across different industries is something I can only get from a project like this.

---

### Introduction Message

**Key points to cover:**

- Brief self-introduction (who you are, when you graduate)
- Show you understand Ryan's actual problem (lead response time)
- Why this feels like a realistic, practical use of AI
- Concrete approach (evaluate first, then build)
- Keep it short — no project names (those go in Q2), no multi-industry angle (that's in Q3)

**Draft:**

> Hi, I'm Jindo. I'm a final-semester student at Conestoga College, with backend development and AI integration experience.
>
> This project stood out because it's one of the most realistic ways to add AI to an existing website: your clients already have quote forms generating leads, and the gap is response time. An AI SMS agent that picks up where the form leaves off and books a call is a practical solution that adds real value to businesses you're already maintaining.
>
> My approach would be to start by scoping the best SMS and AI tools for your setup, then build and test a working agent that you can configure and deploy across your client sites without needing to touch the code.

## Deep Dive: How This Actually Works

### The User Flow

```
1. 잠재고객이 웹사이트에서 quote form 제출 (이름, 전화번호, 요청 내용)
         ↓ webhook trigger
2. 시스템이 그 전화번호로 SMS 즉시 발송
         "안녕하세요, 견적 요청 감사합니다..."
         ↓↑ 1:1 대화 루프 (문자)
3. AI agent가 자연어로 대화 (업종별 맥락 이해)
         "어떤 종류의 지붕인가요? 면적은 대략 어느 정도?"
         ↓
4. 적절한 시점에 캘린더 링크 전송
         "정확한 견적을 위해 30분 상담 잡으시겠어요? [링크]"
```

### Why SMS (Not Email, Not Chatbot)

- Ryan의 클라이언트는 건설, HVAC, 치과 같은 **로컬 SMB**
- 이 업종의 고객은 현장 노동자, 바쁜 사람들 → 이메일보다 **문자에 반응**
- SMS open rate ~98% vs 이메일 ~20%
- 앱 설치 불필요, 모든 폰에서 동작

### Why AI (Not Just Automated Messages)

단순 자동 응답이면 코드 10줄로 끝난다:
```
if (form_submitted) → send_sms("감사합니다! 미팅 예약: [링크]")
```

하지만 Ryan이 원하는 건 **"engaging with prospects in a natural way"** = 자연스러운 대화:
- 업종마다 질문이 다르다 (건설: 면적/자재, 치과: 보험/증상, HVAC: 장비 종류)
- 잠재고객이 뭐라고 보낼지 예측 불가 → LLM이 맥락 이해하고 응답
- 같은 AI agent에 프롬프트/FAQ만 바꾸면 건설업체든 치과든 적용 가능

### Why "Reusable Across Client Websites"

Ryan은 30개+ SMB 클라이언트의 웹사이트를 관리하고 있다:

```
Ryan의 클라이언트 A (건설) → quote form → AI SMS agent (건설용 FAQ, A의 캘린더)
Ryan의 클라이언트 B (치과) → quote form → AI SMS agent (치과용 FAQ, B의 캘린더)
Ryan의 클라이언트 C (보험) → quote form → AI SMS agent (보험용 FAQ, C의 캘린더)
                                    ↑
                            전부 같은 시스템, 설정만 다름
```

각 클라이언트에게 upsell: *"웹사이트에서 리드 들어오죠? 응답 느려서 놓치고 있잖아요. AI SMS agent 달아드릴게요."*

### Required Modules

| 모듈 | 역할 | 난이도 |
|------|------|--------|
| **Form webhook receiver** | 웹사이트 폼 제출 → 시스템 트리거 | 낮음 |
| **SMS 송수신** | Twilio 등 API 연동 (발송 + 수신 콜백) | 중간 |
| **대화 상태 관리** | 누구와 어디까지 대화했는지 추적 | 중간 |
| **LLM 프롬프트 엔진** | 업종별 system prompt + FAQ + 대화 히스토리 → 응답 | 중간 |
| **캘린더 연동** | 적절한 시점에 booking 링크 전송 | 낮음 |
| **설정 관리** | 클라이언트별 설정 (업체명, FAQ, 캘린더 URL) | 중간 |
| **Logging / metrics** | deliverable 2번의 performance metrics | 낮음 |

### Build vs Off-the-Shelf

**직접 코드 작성 (Twilio + OpenAI API):**
- 유연하지만 60시간 안에 빡빡
- 코딩 40hr+ → 문서화 시간 부족
- 유지보수를 Ryan이 직접 못 함

**Off-the-shelf 플랫폼 활용 (권장):**
- 위 모듈 대부분이 이미 내장
- 60시간을 연동/설정/테스팅/문서화에 집중
- Ryan이 직접 운영 가능

| 작업 | 예상 시간 |
|------|----------|
| 플랫폼 선정/평가 | ~10hr |
| 프롬프트 설계 + 업종별 FAQ | ~10hr |
| 웹사이트 폼 연동 | ~5hr |
| 테스팅 + 튜닝 | ~15hr |
| 문서화 (report + user guide) | ~15hr |
| 두 번째 클라이언트 배포 테스트 | ~5hr |
| **합계** | **~60hr** |

### Potential Off-the-Shelf Platforms

**Layer 1: SMS API (메시지 송수신)**
- Twilio — 업계 표준, 가장 유명
- Vonage (Nexmo) — Twilio 대안
- MessageBird — 유럽 기반, 글로벌

**Layer 2: AI + SMS 통합 솔루션**
- OpenAI API + Twilio — 직접 연동 (가장 유연, 개발 필요)
- Retell AI — AI SMS/voice agent 전문 플랫폼
- Sendbird AI Agent — SMS AI agent 기능 내장
- GoHighLevel — SMB 마케팅 자동화 + AI SMS (웹 디자인 에이전시에 인기, white-label 가능)

> **참고:** GoHighLevel은 Ryan의 비즈니스 모델에 특히 적합할 수 있음. 웹 디자인 에이전시들이 클라이언트에게 white-label로 제공하는 도구로, "deployable across client websites" 요구사항에 바로 맞음.

### 접근 방식 비교: 개발량 vs 포트폴리오 가치

| 접근 방식 | 개발량 | 포트폴리오 가치 |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **GoHighLevel 풀 사용** | 거의 없음 (설정 + 문서화) | 낮음 |
| **OpenAI API + Twilio 직접 연동** | 상당함 (webhook, 상태 관리, 프롬프트 엔진 직접 코딩) | 높음 |
| **Retell AI / Sendbird** | 중간 (API 연동 + 커스터마이징) | 중간 |

**권장: OpenAI API + Twilio 직접 연동**

완전 off-the-shelf(GoHighLevel)은 Ryan이 혼자 해도 되는 수준이고, 그걸 하려고 Riipen 학생을 쓰진 않을 것이다. OpenAI + Twilio 조합이면 실제 코딩할 부분이 충분하다:

- Express/FastAPI 서버 (webhook 수신)
- Twilio API 연동 (SMS 송수신)
- OpenAI/Claude API 연동 (대화 생성)
- 대화 상태 관리 (DB/메모리)
- 클라이언트별 설정 시스템 (업종, FAQ, 캘린더 URL)
- 배포 스크립트

Intro Message에서 "evaluate existing platforms first"라고 썼으므로, 평가 결과 OpenAI+Twilio 조합으로 가는 것이 자연스러운 흐름.

### 플랫폼 비용 비교

| 플랫폼 | 가격 | 비고 |
|--------|------|------|
| **GoHighLevel** | $97-$497/month | 에이전시 플랜, 가장 비쌈 |
| **Twilio** | SMS 발신 ~$0.0079/건, 전화번호 $1/month | 수신 무료, 개발 단계 거의 무료 |
| **OpenAI API** | GPT-4o: ~$2.50-$10/1M tokens | 테스팅 단계 $5-20이면 충분 |
| **Retell AI** | $0.07-$0.20/minute | AI 특화 |
| **Sendbird** | Free tier 있음 | 그 이상은 custom pricing |

**Twilio + OpenAI 조합은 개발 단계에서 거의 무료에 가깝다.** 테스트 SMS 수백 건 + API 호출 합쳐서 $15-30 수준. GoHighLevel은 $97/month 최소이며, 이건 Ryan이 이미 쓰고 있거나 프로젝트 비용으로 부담할 수 있다 (학생이 낼 이유 없음).

**결론:** OpenAI API + Twilio가 가장 균형잡힌 선택:
- 실제 코딩이 있고 (포트폴리오 가치)
- 비용이 개발 단계에서 거의 없고
- Intro Message의 "evaluate first" 전략과 맞고
- 60시간에 실현 가능하고
- GoHighLevel보다 커스터마이징 유연성 제공
