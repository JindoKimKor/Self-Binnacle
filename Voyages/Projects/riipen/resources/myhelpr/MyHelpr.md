## Project Details

**Categories:** Artificial Intelligence, Software Development

**Skills:** Systems Architecture, Scalability, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Social Work

**Supported Causes:** No Poverty

### Description

The project aims to enhance MyHelpr's AI-powered platform, which connects individuals to government and social services through intelligent eligibility matching. The current platform, while functional, requires improvements in performance and scalability to better serve a growing user base.

Focus areas:
- Optimizing the matching engine for faster and more accurate service recommendations
- Refactoring backend logic to enhance system robustness and maintainability
- Handling increased demand and providing a more seamless user experience

### Deliverables

1. Detailed report on current system's performance bottlenecks and proposed solutions
2. Optimized version of the matching engine with improved scalability
3. Refactored backend logic — documented and implemented for enhanced system stability
4. Presentation summarizing improvements and their impact on platform performance

## Fit Analysis (vs. My Experience)

### Required Skills Match

| Required Skill | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Systems Architecture** | Strong | VARLab: monolithic → domain-driven 4-layer architecture / Pilot Things: Model-Service-Interface architecture |
| **Scalability** | Strong | VARLab: 94.88% cost reduction via on-demand cloud provisioning, modular build/test environment |
| **Software Engineering** | Strong | Backend across Spring Boot, Django, ASP.NET, Node.js / CI/CD infrastructure from scratch |
| **Artificial Intelligence** | Weak | No direct AI/ML experience — but project is enhancing an *existing* AI platform, not building one from scratch |
| **Social Work** | None | No domain experience — MyHelpr's domain is government & social services |

### Focus Area Match

| Project Focus | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Optimizing matching engine** | Partial | Performance optimization experience (93% faster builds, 80% build server improvement) — but not AI-specific optimization |
| **Refactoring backend logic** | Strong | VARLab: transformed 5 monolithic pipelines (37% duplication) into clean architecture / Helprr.ai: Django backend lead |
| **Handling increased demand** | Strong | Cloud provisioning strategy, Docker containerization, scalability-focused infrastructure work |

### Strengths for This Role

- Backend refactoring with measurable impact is exactly what they need
- Experience working in small teams (Helprr.ai startup, VARLab lab) — matches MyHelpr's 2-10 employee size
- Track record of documenting and presenting improvements (analysis docs, deliverable alignment)
- Helprr.ai experience is in a **very similar domain** (connecting people to services)

### Gaps to Address

- **AI/ML**: No hands-on AI experience — need to frame as "enhancing platform infrastructure around AI", not "building AI models"
- **Social Work domain**: Unfamiliar territory — Helprr.ai experience partially bridges this (similar mission of connecting people to support)
- **Python ecosystem**: Django experience exists (Helprr.ai) but matching engine may use Python ML libraries (unknown)

### Pre-Join Checklist

- [ ] Backend tech stack은 뭔지 (Python? Node? 어떤 프레임워크?)
- [ ] "매칭 엔진"이 실제로 어떻게 구현되어 있는지 (ML 모델? 규칙 기반? 아직 없는 건지?)
- [ ] 리팩토링 대상 코드가 실제로 존재하는지 (코드베이스 규모, 상태)

### Overall Assessment

**Good fit for the backend/scalability/architecture side.** The AI-specific optimization is the main risk area — but the project description emphasizes *performance, scalability, and refactoring* more than building new AI models. Helprr.ai experience is a strong narrative bridge (same mission: connecting people to services).

## Application (Submitted 2026-02-14)

### Q: How do you plan to manage your time and contribute approximately 8-10 hours per week to this project?

I'm in my final semester at Conestoga (graduating April 2026) with a lighter course load. I manage my commitments through Google Calendar and an AI-assisted personal management system, so adding dedicated blocks for MyHelpr is straightforward.

### Q: What unique skills/experiences do you believe sets you apart to make you a strong fit for this project?

I went through Canada's PR process myself, so I know firsthand how confusing government and social services can be for users like MyHelpr's. Technically, I'm currently the backend lead at Helprr.ai, which does something very similar (connecting people to support services), and at VARLab I broke apart monolithic systems into scalable architecture, cutting infra costs by 94.88%. I'd bring both that personal context and hands-on scalability experience to this project.

### Q: How does this project—or the industry it represents—align with your career goals?

I'm graduating in April and actively looking for backend/infrastructure roles focused on scalable systems. This project lines up well with that. Performance optimization, backend refactoring, and working on a system that needs to handle growing demand are exactly the kind of problems I want to solve. MyHelpr has a clear technical challenge, and that's what drew me in.
