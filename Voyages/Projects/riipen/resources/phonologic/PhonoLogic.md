# PhonoLogic Quality Assurance Challenge

> **Moderate fit.** Location blocker 없음 (Canada 전체). QA/systems analysis가 테스팅/트러블슈팅 배경과 연결되지만, data quality/usability 쪽은 약함. 90 hrs / $2,100 — 규모는 작지만 수행 가능. MyHelpr 대비 backup 옵션.

> **Program:** Riipen FuturePath Fall 2025 / Winter 2026 Cohort
> **Status:** Applications OPEN

## Fit Analysis (vs. My Experience)

### Required Skills Match

| Required Skill | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Quality Assurance** | Moderate | VARLab — enabled 80% code coverage from 0; established CI/CD testing infrastructure; but this is automated QA, not manual UAT |
| **Systems Analysis** | Strong | VARLab — analyzed build lifecycle, team workflow, server capacity trade-offs; Helprr.ai — SDLC establishment |
| **Data Quality / Integrity** | Weak | No direct data quality management or data validation pipeline experience |
| **AI / Machine Learning** | ✅ Used | gilJOBi — LLM integration, distributed processing pipeline (Apache Spark + Claude CLI) |
| **Product Lifecycle Management** | ✅ Used | Helprr.ai — led team's first SDLC; unified feature specification format |
| **Usability Testing** | Weak | No direct UX/usability testing experience on resume |
| **Acceptance Testing** | Weak | No explicit UAT experience; adjacent from CI/CD testing work |
| **Bug Reporting** | Moderate | Implied from QA/testing/troubleshooting work but no formal bug reporting evidence |

### Strengths for This Role

- **No location blocker** — Canada-wide eligibility
- Systems-level thinking aligns well (analyzing how components interact)
- Bug identification is adjacent to server troubleshooting experience (VARLab build server stabilization)
- AI/ML background gives context for evaluating ML training data quality
- Process improvement mindset transfers to QA recommendations
- 90 hrs is manageable scope

### Gaps to Address

- **Manual QA/UAT**: My testing background is CI/CD automation, not manual exploratory testing
- **Data quality for ML**: No direct experience validating training data
- **Usability assessment**: No UX testing methodology experience
- **Low compensation**: C$2,100.60 vs MyHelpr's potential (if matched)
- **Education domain**: No prior EdTech experience

### Overall Assessment

**Moderate fit as a backup option.** The biggest advantage is no location restriction (Canada-wide). Systems analysis and QA-adjacent skills transfer, but the core work (manual bug reporting, data quality for ML, usability testing) is outside my demonstrated experience. Worth applying if MyHelpr doesn't materialize, but not a strong primary target.
