# ~~Esty Montreal - Senior Data / Software Associate~~ (PASS)

> **Weak fit.** Montréal 거주 제한 (hard blocker) + data engineering 주니어 포지션이라 backend/infrastructure 프로필과 안 맞음. 420 hrs / $9,803 보수는 매력적이나 역할 자체가 미스매치.

> **Program:** Riipen FuturePath Fall 2025 / Winter 2026 Cohort

## Fit Analysis (vs. My Experience)

### Required Skills Match

| Required Skill | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | Moderate | Django backend at Helprr.ai — but not data processing / scripting focused |
| **SQL** | Moderate | Experience across MongoDB, MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL — but not heavy query optimization |
| **Data Processing / Cleansing** | Weak | No direct data pipeline or ETL experience |
| **Git** | Strong | Daily use across all roles, GitHub Ruleset configuration at Helprr.ai |
| **Code Review** | Strong | Mentored junior developer at Helprr.ai, established CI/CD with SonarQube |
| **Scripting** | Strong | Shell scripting throughout VARLab, Groovy for Jenkins pipelines |

### Focus Area Match

| Project Focus | Match | My Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **SQL query writing/optimization** | Moderate | Used databases across all roles — but not as primary focus |
| **Python data scripts** | Weak | Django (web framework) ≠ data processing (pandas, numpy, etc.) |
| **Backend logic & internal tools** | Strong | Backend across Spring Boot, Django, ASP.NET, Node.js |
| **Dataset cleaning & validation** | Weak | No direct experience |

### Strengths for This Role

- Strong mentorship culture fits — I've both mentored (Helprr.ai) and been mentored
- Git/code review expertise exceeds "nice to have" level
- Backend logic support aligns well
- Startup experience (Helprr.ai) matches early-stage environment
- 420 hours = substantial engagement, good for portfolio

### Gaps to Address

- **Location restriction**: Montréal only — this is a hard constraint
- **Data focus**: My profile is backend/infrastructure, not data engineering
- **Python for data**: Django ≠ pandas/numpy/data pipelines — different Python ecosystem
- **Overqualified?**: Role targets 3rd-year CS students for learning-focused tasks — my experience level may not match the mentorship structure

### Overall Assessment

**Weak fit despite good compensation.** The Montréal location restriction is likely a blocker. Even if location works, this is a data-focused junior role with heavy mentorship — my backend/infrastructure profile is adjacent but not aligned. The 420 hours and $9,802.80 are attractive, but the role is designed for someone earlier in their learning journey. MyHelpr remains the strongest match.
