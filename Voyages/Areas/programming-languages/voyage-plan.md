title: "[Area] Programming Languages"
created: 2026-01-23
---

## Why
- Starting point for understanding what frameworks exist for each language and which OS System Calls (APIs) they commonly use
- Gaining deeper insights into programming concepts through cross-language comparison (e.g., how different languages handle data types, memory, concurrency - and *why* they differ)
- Learning language-specific characteristics and best practices

## What
Comparative study and deep learning of programming languages (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, etc.)

## How
- Cross-language comparisons → `resources/comparisons/`
- Language-specific deep dives → `resources/{language}/`

## Sailing Orders

### Plotted (Underway)

| Order | Deadline | Created | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Consolidate distributed programming language study materials | - | 2026-01-23 | Gather scattered learning materials into one place |

- Sources: Miro, Discord, Confluence, Google Docs, OneDrive
- Search and organize language comparison docs from each platform
- Categorize into `resources/` folders by topic

### Plotted Courses

| Order | Deadline | Created | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Research "Why Different?" questions in data-types-comparison | - | 2026-01-23 | Understand design decisions behind language differences |

- Source: `resources/comparisons/data-types-comparison-python-csharp-java.md`
- Research each TODO item and document findings
- Topics include:
  - Python: no char type, arbitrary precision int, truthy/falsy, singleton None
  - Java: no unsigned types, no generators, no tuple, Optional vs nullable
  - C#: decimal built-in, Span/Memory introduction
  - CPython internals: arbitrary precision, list storage, compact dict
