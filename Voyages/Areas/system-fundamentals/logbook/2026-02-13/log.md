## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Created cloud-security-features.md: Organized cloud security features across 4 categories (Access Control, Data Protection, Network Defense, Detection/Response) with AWS vs Azure vs GCP comparison

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
-

### Next Steps
-

### References
- [cloud-security-features.md](../../resources/networking/cloud-security-features.md)
- [API Terms Infographic](api-terms-infographic.png)
- [Cloud Security Features Comparison (AWS vs Azure vs GCP)](cloud-security-features-comparison.png)

### Notes
- IAM + MFA + PAM form the access control triad: identity → multi-factor → privileged access
- Regular Firewall (IP/port) vs WAF (HTTP content analysis, Layer 7) vs DDoS Protection (traffic volume) — each defends against different attack vectors
- Security & Governance = "are rules followed?" vs Threat Detection = "are threats present?" — complementary monitoring approaches
- KMS is inseparable from encryption — encryption without key management is meaningless
