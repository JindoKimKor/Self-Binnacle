title: "[Area] System Fundamentals"
created: 2026-01-23
---

## Why
- Systematic learning of computer science fundamentals
- Central hub for CS knowledge not covered by other specialized Areas

## What
**Everything except Software Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Programming Languages** - all other computer science topics are studied and organized in this Voyage.

**Topics (examples):**
- Networking (TCP/IP, Socket, HTTP)
- Runtimes (JVM, CLR, PVM, V8)
- Operating Systems (Memory, System Call, Process)
- Cloud Computing
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Security
- etc.

## How
- Organize by topic in `resources/` after learning
- Split into separate Area when a topic grows large enough
