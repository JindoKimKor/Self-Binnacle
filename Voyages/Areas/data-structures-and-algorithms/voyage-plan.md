title: "[Area] Data Structures and Algorithms"
created: 2024-07-14

## Why
- Technical interview preparation
- Software engineering fundamentals

## What
Continuous study of data structures and algorithms for technical interviews and software engineering fundamentals.

## How

### Learning Approach
1. Understand basic data structures - when to use each
2. Pattern recognition - "This is a two pointer problem"
3. Complexity analysis habit - always think Big O
4. Optimization thinking - "Is there a better way?"

> LeetCode's real value is internalizing this thought process. Understanding 30 problems deeply is better than solving 100 superficially.

## Data Structures

### Linear
- Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Deque

### Non-linear
- Tree (Binary Tree, BST, Heap), Graph

### Hashing
- HashMap, HashSet

### Advanced
- Trie, Union-Find, Segment Tree

---

## Algorithm Patterns
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- DFS/BFS
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- Backtracking

---

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)
- Space: Additional memory usage
- Trade-offs: Time vs Space, Readability vs Performance
