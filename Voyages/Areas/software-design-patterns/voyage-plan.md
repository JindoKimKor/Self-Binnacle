### Plotted Courses

> | Deadline | Created | Order | Purpose |
> |----------|---------|-------|---------|
> | - | 2026-01-19 | Write practical design patterns guide based on VARLab Code Debt experience | Transform hands-on experience into systematic knowledge |
>
> <details>
> <summary>Details</summary>
>
> - Phase 1: Decision Tree - Business logic type → Pattern selection flowchart
> - Phase 2: Pattern Catalog - Details for each pattern (When to use + OOP implementation + Layer location)
> - Phase 3: Case Study - Map VARLab 51 issues → Real application cases
> - Scope: VARLab 5 patterns (Command, Facade, Service Layer, Builder, Strategy) → Gradual expansion
> - Reference: `Voyages/Projects/VARLab-work-transfer/portfolios/devops-jenkins-linux/retrospective-analysis-from-5-monolithic-pipelines-to-4-layer-architecture/`

### Plotted (Reached)

> | Deadline | Created | Order | Purpose |
> |----------|---------|-------|---------|
> | - | 2026-01-23 | Map VARLab 4-Layer Architecture to DDD concepts | Clarify DDD understanding through hands-on experience |
>
> <details>
> <summary>Result</summary>
>
> - Created `domain-driven-analysis.md` analyzing DDD pattern applicability
> - Key learning: Intention-Revealing Interfaces - descriptive ≠ intention-revealing
> - Strategic DDD (Layered Architecture, Modules) applicable; Tactical DDD (Entities, Aggregates) not applicable to stateless pipelines
> - Reference: `Voyages/Projects/VARLab-work-transfer/portfolios/devops-jenkins-linux/retrospective-analysis-from-5-monolithic-pipelines-to-4-layer-architecture/problem-solving/domain-driven-analysis.md`
