## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Encountered a teammate's message that was hard to parse due to comma splices

### Blockers
-

### Reflection
- Comma splices in casual English (texts, Slack) chain independent sentences with commas instead of periods
- This gets confusing when the subject changes mid-chain: "I emailed prof, hope that was okay, she said..."
  - "I emailed prof." (subject: I, action: emailed)
  - "Hope that was okay." (subject: implied you, checking with me)
  - "She said: ..." (subject: she/prof, relaying the reply)
- Key takeaway: in casual English, treat commas like periods and identify who the subject is for each clause

### Next Steps

### Notes
- Original context (teammate's message):
  > So I emailed prof, hope that was okay, she said: "An extension is fine by me. Can you submit by EOD Friday?".. I think that will be helpful, since I haven't started the prototype yet. We can still try to get it done before then but now we have some wiggle room. So how about we try to have the prototype and user testing done by Tuesday evening? or Tuesday mid day if all goes well and depending on mid terms. And then by Wednesday morning Jindo and Manva can work on there part? And then when they are done we will still have to do the demo video.
