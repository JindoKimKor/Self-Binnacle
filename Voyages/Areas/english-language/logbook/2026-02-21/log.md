## Log (Monitoring)

### What did I actually do?
- Learned about text abbreviations: "Ima" (= I'm going to), "tn" (= tonight)
- Explored passive vs active voice in casual team chat: "This has been improved" vs "I've updated it"
- Discovered the nuance of "already" — implies action was done *before* the other person mentioned it
- Deep-dived into "though" at end of sentence — contrast mechanism that can soften or push back depending on direction
- Encountered "pane", "magnifying glass", "toggle", and "discrete" while reading Power BI documentation
- Learned "halves" — plural of half, and the -f → -ves pattern (knife→knives, wife→wives)
- Studied "preposition + which" pattern in formal/academic English (by which, for which, in which)
- Learned "correlation" — two things changing together (direct/inverse/no correlation)

### Blockers

### Reflection
- **Text abbreviations**: "Ima" = "I'm going to", "tn" = "tonight" — extremely shortened casual forms common in texting
- **Passive vs Active in casual English**: passive ("This has been improved") sounds formal/stiff in team chat. Active + I ("I've updated it") is more natural and clear about who did it
- **"already" nuance**: "I already updated it" implies you did it *before* the person mentioned it. "I've updated it" is neutral about timing
- **"though" = contrast (대비)**:
  - Core meaning: always introduces contrast
  - Direction toward the situation → softening ("Thank you though" = 못 가지만 그래도 고마워)
  - Direction toward the other person's statement → pushback ("It's been updated though" = 네가 그렇게 말했지만 근데 고쳤어)
  - Key insight: same word, opposite tones — depends on what is being contrasted with what
- **"pane"**: a section/panel of a UI window. From "window pane" (유리창 한 칸). Microsoft products prefer "pane" over "panel" — e.g., "Visualizations pane", "navigation pane"
- **"magnifying glass"**: 돋보기 (magnify = 확대하다 + glass = 렌즈). Used to describe search icons or analytics icons in software UIs
- **"toggle"**: on/off 스위치를 전환하다. Originally a wooden bar button (duffle coat toggle) — push through to lock, pull out to unlock. Same action, opposite result. In IT: one click = flip the state (ON↔OFF)
- **"discrete"**: 개별적인, 분리된 (각각 구분되는). "discrete categories" = 명확히 구분된 카테고리들. ⚠️ "discreet" (ee)와 혼동 주의 — discreet = 신중한, 조심스러운. 완전히 다른 단어
- **"halves"**: half의 복수형 (반쪽들). "discard one of the halves" = 두 반쪽 중 하나를 버린다. 발음: half /hæf/ → halves /hævz/ (f→v). 같은 패턴: knife→knives, wife→wives, leaf→leaves
- **"preposition + which"**: formal/academic 관계절 패턴. 전치사 + which = 앞 명사를 가리키며 관계를 만듦
  - "a way **by which** we can distinguish" = 구분할 수 있는 방법 (by the way)
  - "the tool **by which** we measure" = 측정하는 데 쓰는 도구 (by the tool)
  - "the reason **for which** I came" = 내가 온 이유 (for the reason)
  - Casual 대체: "a way **to** distinguish" — 같은 뜻, 덜 formal
- **"correlation"**: 상관관계 — 두 가지가 함께 변하는 관계. direct correlation (A↑→B↑), inverse correlation (A↑→B↓), no correlation. 유명한 표현: "Correlation doesn't imply causation" (상관관계 ≠ 인과관계)

### Notes
- Original context (teammate's message about data pipeline):
  > I don't think she would have the context of "what data pipeline steps we have". And it seems a bit confusing if you don't know we have step 1, 2, 3, LLM processes and all. But I guess modification is not necessary, so it's cool
- My initial reply: "This has been improved" → more natural: "I've updated it"
- Original context (Power BI documentation):
  > Click chart → Analytics icon (magnifying glass in Visualizations pane)
  > Constant line → + Add line
  > Set value to 0.8 (since the measure returns decimals)
  > Optionally change color to red/dashed for visibility

  > Pareto Charts are based on categorical data, which means they deal with discrete categories or groups.
- Original context (Time Complexity article):
  > we discard one of the halves
- Original context (Time Complexity article):
  > there has to be a way by which we can distinguish these different approaches
- Original context (Time Complexity article):
  > We can get a direct correlation with the length of the input.
