## Why
- Collect and retain English expressions, words, and phrases I encounter but don't know
- Build a personal reference bank from real encounters with original context preserved

## What
A daily-driven English learning log. Each day I record what I encountered or was curious about, with the original context (video, conversation, article, trying to express something). Resources consolidate these daily entries into a scannable reference.

## How
1. Encounter an unknown expression, word, or phrase in daily life
2. Record it in today's logbook passage with original context (source, situation, what I was trying to do)
3. Periodically consolidate logbook entries into resources for quick reference

### AI Log Organization
When organizing Raw entries in log.md for this voyage:
- **Reflection**: Identify the linguistic concept/pattern (e.g., comma splices, idiom, grammar point) and explain why it was confusing
- **Reflection (Passive → Active)**: For expressions the user understands but can't actively produce — note why it's hard to use and suggest usage examples
- **Reflection (Weak Recognition)**: For words the user knows but didn't immediately recall while reading — reinforce the meaning
- **Notes**: Preserve the original context verbatim as a blockquote (the source text that triggered the question)
- **What did I actually do?**: Brief summary of what was encountered
