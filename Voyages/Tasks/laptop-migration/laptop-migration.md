title: "[Task] Laptop Migration"

## Context
Cleaning up old laptop and selling it. Also considering selling headphones since rarely used.

## Steps
- [x] Transfer necessary data
- [x] Clean old laptop
- [x] Verify actual specs from laptop (before factory reset)
- [ ] Factory reset old laptop
- [x] List for resale
- [x] Decide whether to sell headphones

## Resources
- Old laptop purchase record: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/the+source/FMfcgzGrbldDVWFkhQXkMSBlPSHhKRQd


## Expectation & Reflection

### Outcome
- expect: Several hours to get everything done
- actual: Took 3 days total - 2 days for data transfer, 2 more days waiting for Amazon delivery (ordered glue and electric air compressor without knowing if needed for cleaning)

### Learn
- expect: Easy job
- actual: If files were well-managed regularly, this would have been much faster. Even with fast computers, transferring 30GB via external HDD took several hours of waiting

### Harvest
- expect: None
- actual: Learned about OS-level browser integration - when switching from ASUS to Acer, had to disable "MediaFoundation Video Capture" flag in Chrome browsers to get camera working properly. Discovered new tech contracts between system components

**TODO: Verify from System Info before factory reset**

### Transfer necessary data:
- **Project code**: Reduced from 60GB → 30GB (deleted node_modules, Unity Library). If GitHub was well-maintained, could have just cloned without worrying about transfer
- **Opera Pinboard sync**: Only copy log and db files when migrating DB (exclude Current). Must generate shared link from Pinboard on old laptop for it to be included in DB. Sync method is weird, considering migration to different browser later
