## 1. Dashboard (README.md)

See the current state at a glance.

> **What you can see on Dashboard:**
> - List of ongoing Voyages (Tasks, Projects, Areas)
> - GitHub Contribution Graph style activity visualization
>   - `■□□■■□□■□□□□■■□□□□■□□□■□□□□□` ← Monthly activity pattern
>   - See at a glance which days worked (■) vs not (□)
> - Monthly/total time investment (e.g., "Total: 114.8h since Sep 01")
> - Recent activity per Voyage

> **Auto-generated:**
> - README.md auto-generated by script (based on Time Management App data)
> - User doesn't manually edit

> **Not implemented:**
> - Missing record alerts
> - Long-abandoned Voyage warnings

---

## 2. Logbook Reminder (Not implemented)

Records become assets later.

> **Problem:**
> - Time block exists in Time Management App but no Log?
> - Next time: "What did I do?" Starting from scratch

> **Solution:**
> - Compare Time Management App vs Logbook
> - Alert on Dashboard when record missing
> - "Worked on Unity CI on 12/19, but no Log!" ⚠️

> **Recording by category:**
>
> | Category | Logbook | Progress Tracker | Reason |
> |----------|---------|------------------|--------|
> | Task | ❌ | ❌ | Just finish it |
> | Project | ✅ | ✅ | Process tracking, catch-up next session |
> | Area | ✅ | ✅ | Process tracking, catch-up next session |

## 3. AI Scan (Not implemented)

Automatically detect principle violations and structure deviations.

> ### Security Scan (Sensitive Information Detection)
>
> **Problem:**
> - Accidentally write sensitive info in Logbook or Voyage Plan
> - Risk when making public or sharing later
>
> **Detection targets:**
> - API keys / tokens
> - Passwords
> - Email addresses
> - Phone numbers
> - Credit card numbers
> - Private URLs (internal systems)
> - Other personally identifiable information (PII)

> ### Scope Scan (Scope Deviation Detection)
>
> **Problem:**
> - Content outside this system's scope gets mixed in
> - Untrackable categories emerge
>
> **Detection targets:**
> - User-defined principle violations
> - Content outside system scope (finance management, relationship management, etc.)

> ### Structure Scan (Structure Deviation Detection)
>
> **Problem:**
> - Structure inconsistency due to human error
>
> **Detection targets:**
> - Voyage misclassified as Task
> - Missing required files (no voyage-plan.md, etc.)
> - Folder structure inconsistency
> - Missing required template sections

## 4. Self Reflection Report (Not implemented)

Compare only with my past self.

> **Principles:**
> - ❌ Don't compare with others
> - ❌ Don't compare with ideal standards
> - ✅ Compare only with my past self

> **Comparison items:**
>
> | Item | Example |
> |------|---------|
> | Time investment | "This week 12h vs last week 8h (+50%)" |
> | Frequency | "English Training 5 times vs last month avg 3 times" |
> | Focus area | "This month 70% on Project (last month 50%)" |
> | Consistency | "Unity CI worked 5 consecutive days (longest streak!)" |
> | Recording rate | "Log completion 80% vs last month 60%" |

> **Report frequency:**
> - Weekly: Simple summary
> - Monthly: Detailed analysis + trends
