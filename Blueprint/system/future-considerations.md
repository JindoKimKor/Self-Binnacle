Ideas, features, and improvements to consider for the Self-Binnacle system.

## Structure & Organization

- [ ] Some areas (e.g., reading, learning) may need sub-categorization. Consider how to handle this - could be naming convention (prefix), sub-folders, or other approaches.

---

## Definitions

- [ ] Clear definition of Task vs Project vs Area criteria needed in terminology.md or ontology.md

---

## Features

- [ ] AI Passage Evaluation (`ai-passage-evaluation.md`) - AI-assisted analysis of each passage to identify what went well, areas for improvement, and patterns. Supports metacognition improvement and voyage analysis. Could become a standard part of the passage structure.
