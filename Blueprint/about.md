## System Name: Self-Binnacle

### System Essence
I navigate myself as a ship in the ocean of life. Self-Binnacle is a framework that holds my defined north (reference point) and voyage records. I forecast today's direction, keep records, and review my forecasts. Using AI, I analyze deviations and patterns, turning accumulated records into assets I can leverage in the present moment.

---

### Mission
- Enhance metacognition: Strengthen self-awareness through forecast → execution → review cycles
- Design each day intentionally: Forecast today's direction, record, and review
- Turn accumulated records into assets: Past data compounds like interest for future voyages
- Maintain personal patterns: AI monitors user-defined patterns to prevent deviation

---

### Value
- **Reduce context switching costs**: Minimize time spent asking "what was this again?" when resuming work
- **Improve forecast accuracy (metacognition)**: Time/difficulty forecast → actual comparison → better next forecast
- **Turn records into assets**: PARA categories + metacognition cycle + time management app integration → naturally accumulated patterned records → AI-analyzable assets

### Meaning of the Name

**Binnacle (The Container)**
| Binnacle Characteristics | System Characteristics |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Tool that stores compass + logbook | System that holds framework/structure |
| Fixed position on ship | Reference point accessible from anywhere |

**Compass (Direction)**
| Compass Characteristics | System Characteristics |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Always points north | Provides user-defined reference point (patterns/principles) |
| Shows current heading | Visualizes current state/direction (Dashboard) |
| Enables comparison between reference and current direction | Uses AI to detect and alert pattern deviations |
| Doesn't force direction | User makes decisions; AI only observes/analyzes/guides |

**Logbook (Records)**
| Logbook Characteristics | System Characteristics |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Accumulates voyage records | Stores records (Logbook, Archive) |
| Uses past data as reference | Accumulated knowledge (Resources) |
| Discovers and analyzes patterns | Uses AI to analyze patterns from historical data |
| Leverages for future voyages | Self-feedback, Presentable |

### Role of AI
- Pattern generator ❌
- **Pattern monitor/coach** ✅
- Analyzes/understands user-defined patterns → monitors whether user maintains their patterns → alerts on deviation
