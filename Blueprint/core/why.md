## Part 1: Awakening

### 1.1 The Trigger

> One night, I suddenly realized something. During my school break when I had nothing to do, I was actually depressed, felt like my hormones weren't working, couldn't find joy in anything, and found myself drinking frequently.
>
> Then a thought flashed through my mind: **"Oh, I'm like this because I can't feel any enjoyment."**

### 1.2 The State I Fell Into

> Once the semester ended and the tasks, evaluations, and obligations disappeared, I immediately fell into something like a depressive state.
>
> Watching anime, reading webtoons, watching YouTube, continuing software work, cooking delicious food, watching TV—none of it was enjoyable. That's where I was.

💡 Then I suddenly realized: **"Oh, I became depressed because my goals and purposes disappeared, leaving me with too much empty time."**

---

## Part 2: Questions

> After realizing "I become depressed when goals disappear," one thought led to another.
>
> - **Why do retired men become depressed?** - They lived according to company goals—goals set by others—and when those disappear, they feel empty. When roles disappear, your sense of purpose wavers.
>
> - **Why do people start their own businesses?** - It's better because it's my goal rather than someone else's. When I see passionate YouTube channel creators, I get that feeling. The passion, the consistency. Because it's something I found and chose to do myself.

🤔 **"So do I always need to have goals? Can I live without focusing on goals?"**

---

## Part 3: Insight

### 3.1 The Dilemma

> If I don't center my life on goals, what should I center it on?
>
> Recently, I've been seeing a lot of content saying "live each day fully." What does that mean?

🤔 **"Does living each day fully mean living without goals?"**

### 3.2 Not a Choice, But a Matter of Perspective

> Then I suddenly remembered a conversation I had with a friend while watching The Walking Dead together.
>
> For example, while watching The Walking Dead:
> - **My friend**: Enjoyed the thrill of killing zombies, the survival action
> - **Me**: Focused on the interactions between people in difficult decisions, emotional dilemmas, choosing to die together when someone you relied on gets bitten rather than surviving alone, situations where you can only save one of two close people, moments when someone crosses the boundaries of their moral values to protect their group...
>
> **Same show, different focus.** There were probably many other elements too, each existing as a recipe that could become someone's focal point.

🤔 **"Then can't 'pursuing daily fulfillment' and 'pursuing goals and purposes' coexist with just different focal points?"**

### 3.3 Goals vs. Today's Fulfillment

|  | Focus on Today's Fulfillment | Focus on Goals/Purposes |
|--|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Has Goals** | Satisfied if today is fulfilling; goals provide direction | Today becomes a mere means for goals |
| **No Goals** | Satisfied if today is fulfilling | Emptiness (the state I fell into) |

> Looking at this table, it might seem like I'm saying goal-oriented focus is bad. But from my life experience of living for goals and purposes, I've felt, seen, and learned several things.

#### First, finding goals is not easy.

> Finding goals, purposes themselves is not easy. Gurus say "most people die without knowing what they truly wanted."

#### Second, the danger of "becoming something" goals.

> Once achieved, passion fades. If what you achieved isn't what you wanted, you become unhappy.
>
> A friend of mine spent 10 years preparing to become a lawyer. He finally became one, but repeatedly had to defend bad people for a living. He ended up lamenting, "I should have become a doctor—then I could actually help people." He often said if he ever won the lottery, he'd want to do pro bono work defending good people.

#### Third, defining your goal as creating value.

> Like "I will do work that helps sick people." This seems much better than the second approach. You're not tied to a specific job and can achieve it through various professions and actions.
>
> But even here, you might find it wasn't what you wanted after trying, or age and circumstances might prevent you from continuing. Life rarely goes the way we want.

#### Finally, the core problem.

> I've only talked about the downsides of the second and third approaches, but of course, if what you chose fits well, you can live happily. You might feel satisfied until the end of your life. But unfortunately, most people don't get that outcome.
>
> In the second and third situations, it's easy to end up sacrificing yourself to achieve your purpose. In Korean, there's an expression "grinding myself down." It's often used to mean giving everything to achieve something, but the expression carries self-sacrifice within it. The feeling that each day becomes a mere means for goals.
>
> And what happens if you don't achieve it? What if you treated your days as means, "ground yourself down," but still didn't achieve your goal? Many people actually don't achieve their goals. Often, goals are things only a few can have, yet most people choose them.
>
> Imagine trying for 10 or 20 years and not achieving it. What happens to those 10 or 20 years you "ground down"?...

🤔 **What if, instead, you lived each day fully? What happens to goals then?**

> If you have goals, they can provide direction. If you don't have goals, finding direction itself can become today's fulfillment. Or you could set "goals for just today" rather than long-term direction.
>
> This way, a life centered on living each day fully seems possible.

🤔 **"But how can you put 'is today fulfilling?' at the center?"**

## Part 4: Self-Binnacle

### 4.1 Why Self-Binnacle

> How can I put fulfillment at the center? What if I keep records of whether I'm living each day fully?
>
> And I've had this thought: "I should create my story. I want the path I've traveled to become a good story."
>
> Experienced adults often say "live a life without regrets." I'm not saying we should focus on regret. But what if there's a system where I can live each day fully and create a story from the path I've traveled? While spending fulfilling days, I could give meaning to how fully I've lived, and that itself could become a goal. Those things accumulated could become records proving how fully I've been living.
>
> So I created Self-Binnacle. Because voyages create stories. Like the Age of Exploration.

### 4.2 Voyage = Story

> "Living each day fully" and "creating my story" don't conflict. They connect.
> - A story is not **a record of achieving goals** but **a record of days lived**
> - Even Age of Exploration navigators had "discovering new continents" as their goal, but the real story was in the daily logbook entries
> - Even if you don't reach the destination, the voyage itself becomes a story

> If I create my story through Self-Binnacle, wouldn't it become **a life of accumulating meaning while spending fulfilling days**?
>
> That's why I want to keep metacognition logs. That's why I created Self-Binnacle. Not to achieve goals, but to create a structure for living each day meaningfully.

## Notes

> **Daily Fulfillment Check** - A checklist to check "Was today fulfilling?" at the end of each day
> - Did I focus on the present moment?
> - Did I keep my principles? (e.g., not drinking, exercising, etc.)
> - Was there a moment I felt meaning?
> - ...
>
> → Scoring → Weekly/monthly AI Reflection for pattern analysis
>
> Checklist items, scoring methods, and AI Reflection prompt design needed—will design as a separate feature.
