# Self-Binnacle Principles

---

## 1. Value of Process

Do not automate the user's thinking, forecasting, and judgment processes.

Think about when you create a time block on a calendar. It's not simply putting in "2-hour work":
- How's my condition that day?
- What's the stress from surrounding schedules?
- How much energy does this task require?
- Is it intuitively possible?

Humans are not machines. It's not a calculation like "use 30% energy, 70% remains." We simulate in our heads, consider trade-offs, and make intuitive judgments.

This process is the same throughout all parts of the system: Voyage Plan, Passage Plan, Reflection, etc. This thinking process develops metacognition, and compounds like interest the more it's repeated.

## 2. Don't Fit Thinking to Tools

Don't fit your thinking to the framework set by tools.

- Markdown = unrestricted free format
- I define the structure (framework); tools don't force it
- Framework can be changed flexibly at any time
- Think first, organize later

---

## 3. Data Ownership

I own my data.

- All data in my storage
- Data persists even if service ends
- Export/Backup always possible

---

## 4. Flexible Structure

Same category can have different structures.

- Keep core principles, details are free
- Templates are starting points, not enforced
- Design optimal structure for the domain

---

## 5. Keep it Simple

Core features only; if it gets complex, you won't use it.

Questions before adding new features:
1. Will the system break without this?
2. Can existing apps substitute?
3. How much complexity does this add?

## 6. Role of AI

AI does not generate new content or modify existing content without user's judgment/intention/decision.

AI is used for:
- Detecting violations of user-defined principles (sensitive info, personal behavioral principles, etc.)
- Detecting structural deviations from Self-Binnacle design (human errors like misclassifying Voyage as Task)
- Advice for system sustainability
- Advice for user behavior adjustment
